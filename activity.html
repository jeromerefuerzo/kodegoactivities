        <p>Mapua University extended its second round surge in NCAA Season 98, carving out a 67-47 mastery over Arellano
            University on Wednesday to continue its improbable turnaround.
            Joaqui Garcia topscored with 13 points, including three triples, while Rence Nocum posted 10 points, nine
            rebounds, and five assists to power the Cardinals to the win. Jomer Mercado also chipped in with 10 markers.
            Mapua, which opened its campaign with a woeful 0-8 card, has now won four straight games to ascend to 6-9
            while Arellano slid down to a similar 6-9 slate.</p>
